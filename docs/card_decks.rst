Decks of Cards

Introduction
============

Cards are a common and widely used method of storing and transmitting
small sets of related data.

Scientists have used index cards since the 17th century and, of course,
libraries have long used card catalogues as a way to track information
about books. Businesses in the 20th century used Rolodexes and business
cards as ways to track and exchange information about individuals. Early
computers used a form of index cards called “punch” cards to store their
data. Playing cards, of course, have been popular both in China and
Europe; coming into more widespread use somewhere in the 9th and 14th 
centuries respectively.

The massive rise in popularity of a game like *Magic the Gathering*, from
the 1990s, has inspired the greater use of cards in all aspects of the
modern board gaming experience, with cards taking the predominant role in
many of them.

Basic Concepts
==============

A common element in many games is a deck - or multiple decks - of cards.

    **pyprototypr** also considers items such tiles or counters to be "cards";
    they are really just "shapes containing other shapes"

There are two core concepts: the ``Card()`` and the ``Deck()``.

A ``Card()``command is used to specify the design for a card, or range of
cards, typically using elements that have already been defined.  The patterns
or designs can appear on multiple cards.

A ``Deck()``command is used to specify type, size and number of cards that will 
be used to create all cards in the deck.
