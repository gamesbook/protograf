The `protograf <https://github.com/gamesbook/protograf>`_ documentation
consists of the primary sections listed below.

Although its great to be able to just "jump in" and start using a
program, the sections below are designed to be read in order - apart from
the terminology - as they all contain useful information and build on each
other.

.. _guide:

1.  :doc:`Overview <overview>` - a brief introduction of the purpose and
    rationale of **protograf**
2.  :doc:`Setting Up <setting_up>` - how to get **protograf** working
    on your computer
3.  :doc:`Basic Concepts <basic_concepts>` - core aspects of
    **protograf** that you **must** know
4.  :doc:`A First Example <worked_example>` - step-by-step
    example of setting up and running a script to generate a *deck of cards*
5.  :doc:`Script Anatomy <script_anatomy>` - how a script is constructed
6.  :doc:`Additional Concepts <additional_concepts>` - additional
    aspects of **protograf** that can also help with script creation
7.  :doc:`Core Shapes <core_shapes>` - a tour of the core geometries
    available and how to construct and customise them
8.  :doc:`Working with Cards <card_deck_introduction>` - introduces key
    concepts to create decks of cards; and then :doc:`Card Decks <card_decks>`
    provide details of all the relevant commands, as does the
    :doc:`Deck command <deck_command>`
9.  :doc:`Customised Shapes <customised_shapes>` - how to refine the
    appearance of certain shapes; circles, hexagons, lines and rectangles
10. :doc:`Customised Text <customised_text>` - how to refine the
    appearance of text
11. :doc:`Repetitive Elements <layouts>` - how to work with repeats, sequences,
    tracks and grid layouts
12. :doc:`Hexagonal Grids <hexagonal_grids>` - how to create different types
    of hexagonal grids and customise or add to them
13. :doc:`Additional Commands <additional_commands>` - special commands not part
    of the core shapes; fonts, dates and access to BoardGameGeek data
14. :doc:`Compound Objects <objects>` - special composite shapes not part
    of the core shapes e.g. cubes, dice, polyominoes, pentominoes
15. :doc:`Special Functions <functions>` - special functions for specific
    situations
16. :doc:`Terminology <terminology>` - summary of common jargon and descriptions
    of many of the elements' properties
17. :doc:`Commands <commands>` - summary of all the commands available

The following are supplementary sections that you're likely to need when
doing more advanced scripts or needing further resources:

18. :doc:`Descriptions of Supplied Examples <examples/index>` - brief
    walkthoughs of many of the examples provided with **protograf**
19. :doc:`Working with Fonts <using_fonts>` - how to install and
    use *fonts*, both built-in and additional ones
20. :doc:`Using Python Commands <python_commands>` - how to work with
    *loops*, *if/then* statements and *functions* for more flexibility
21. :doc:`Development Notes <development>` - notes for programmers wanting
    to develop further in or with  **protograf**
22. :doc:`Useful Resources <useful_resources>` - links to
    tools and websites related to boardgame prototyping
