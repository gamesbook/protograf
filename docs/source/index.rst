`protograf <https://github.com/gamesbook/protograf>`_ is a utility written in
Python for designing and creating simple, regular, graphical outputs in PDF
(or PNG/GIF/SVG) format via a script.

**protograf**  has been primarily created to handle the prototyping of cards,
counters, tiles and boards for board games, including hexagonal grids, but can
also be used for creating any simple design that has regular or repetitive
elements; typically a mix of graphics and text.

If it's your first time here, please consult the `guide <guide.html>`_
which presents the sections designed to be read in order; they all contain
useful information but do build on each other.
