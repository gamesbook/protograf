Overview
========
`↑ <table-of-contents-hexg_>`_

Hexagonal grids are now widely used in the table top gaming industry.

They are particularly suitable in providing an overlay for maps and have been
used for decades in war games and role playing games, but can also act as grids
or tiles in regular board games.

Some practical examples of these grids are shown in the section with
both :doc:`commercial <examples/commercial>` and
:doc:`abstract <examples/abstract>` boards.

You should have already seen how a single Hexagon and a basic grid of Hexagons
are created using defaults.
You should also have seen how a single hexagon can be further enhanced
as a :ref:`Customised Hexagon Shape <hexIndex>`.

.. _rectIndex:

Rectangular Hexagonal Grid
==========================
`↑ <table-of-contents-hexg_>`_

The basic hexagonal grid is laid out in a rectangular fashion. It can be
customised in a number of ways.

- `Rows and Columns <rectRowsCols_>`_
- `Coordinates <rectCoords_>`_
- `Caltrops <rectCaltrops_>`_
- `Hidden <rectHidden_>`_
- `Offset <rectOffset_>`_
- `Radii <rectRadii_>`_

.. _rectRowsCols:

Rows and Columns
----------------
`^ <rectIndex_>`_

            x=1, y=1,
            rows=3, cols=3
        )

      It has the following properties that differ from the defaults:

      - *side* - length of each side of a hexagon in the grid
      - *x* and *y* are used to set the upper-left corner of the grid
      - *rows* - number of rows  in the grid
      - *cols* - number of columns in the grid

      - *side* - length of each side of a hexagon in the grid
      - *x* and *y* are used to set the upper-left corner of the grid
      - *rows* - number of rows  in the grid
      - *cols* - number of columns in the grid
      - *orientation* set to``pointy``, ensuring there is a "peak" for
        each hexagon

===== ======

.. _rectCoords:

Coordinates
-----------
`^ <rectIndex_>`_

Every location in a grid has a row and column number |dash| these are not, by
default, displayed on the grid; but they are needed in some cases; for example,
to support grid references for a wargame map.

The coordinate system starts at the top-left of the grid; the column is, by
default, the first value (the "x" location) and the row is the second value
(the "y" location).

The coordinates can be displayed using either letters (upper or lowercase) or
numbers (the default behaviour). A separator may be specified to help
visualise, or differentiate, the row versus the column value. For numeric
coordinates, numbers have a "zero padding"; so ``1`` is displayed as ``01``.

The coordinates can also be displayed in various positions within the hexagon.

Most coordinate property names are prefixed with ``coord_``.

      Each has the following properties that differ from the defaults:

      - *side* - length of each side of a hexagon in the grid
      - *x* and *y* are used to set the upper-left corner of the grid
      - *rows* - number of rows  in the grid
      - *cols* - number of columns in the grid
      - *coord_elevation* can be ``top``, ``middle`` or ``bottom`` to set
        the vertical position of the coordinates text; the horizontal
        always matches to the hexagon's centre

      The white grid also has:

      - *coord_prefix* - this is text that appears before the row and column
        values are shown (to their left)
      - *coord_suffix* - this is text that appears after the row and column
        values are shown (to their right)

      The green grid also has:

      - *coord_type_x* - ``upper`` displays the column (x-value) as an
        uppercase letter
      - *coord_separator* - can be any text used that must be displayed between
        the row and column values; in this case it is two colons ``::``

.. _rectCaltrops:

Caltrops
--------
`^ <rectIndex_>`_

Caltrops is a term when the point at which three hexagons meet is drawn by
a set of three small lines; these replace the normal edge of the hexagon.

      - *caltrops* - size of the caltrop lines
      - *caltrops_invert* - if set to ``True``, this will cause the caltrops
        line to be drawn in the middle between the hexagon vertices; with
        no lines drawn touching those vertices

===== ======

.. _rectHidden:

Hidden
------
`^ <rectIndex_>`_

As every location in a grid has a row and column number, these values can be
used to hide or mask certain hexagons from being displayed.  This can be useful
when a grid is designed for a scenario where not all hexagons are needed.

        )

      Each has the following properties that differ from the defaults:

      - *x* and *y* are used to set the upper-left corner of the grid
      - *rows* - number of rows  in the grid
      - *cols* - number of columns in the grid

      In the **white** flat grid:

      - *hidden* - a string of row and column numbers

      The pairs of comma-delimited row and column numbers are each separated
      by a space.

      In this example, the second row hexagon is hidden in both first and
      second columns.

      In the **green** pointy grid:

      - *hidden* - a list (``[`` to ``]``) of row and column numbers

      The row and column numbers are in the form of one or more sets; with
      each pair enclosed by round brackets.

      In this example, the second and third columns are hidden in both the
      first and the third row.

Circular Hexagonal Grid
=======================
`↑ <table-of-contents-hexg_>`_

An alternative to the basic hexagonal grid, is a circular, or circle, layout.

===== ======


Grid Locations
==============
`↑ <table-of-contents-hexg_>`_

In order to layout objects within a hexagonal grid, it is possible to use
the ``Location()`` or ``Locations()`` command to specify the "what, where
and how".

These commands should work with any of the types of hexagonal grid layouts
described above.

The following are the key properties required for the ``Location()`` or the
``Locations()`` command:

- *grid* - a grid, or the name assigned to a grid
- *coordinates* - these are coordinates assigned when creating the grid; if
  none have been assigned, the default numbering is used i.e. a label made
  up of two 2-digit numbers (each padded with zero) which correspond to the
  row and column - bear in mind the numbering starts at the top-left of the
  grid
- *shapes* - a list (using square brackets `[` and `]`) of one of more shapes,
  appearing in the order that they must be drawn; the centre of the shapes
  will be set to match the centre of the hexagon in which its drawn.

All examples below make use of a common property (assigned to the
name *a_circle*) defined as:

  .. code:: python

    a_circle = Common(radius=0.4)

            "0101",
            [circle(common=a_circle)]
        )

      The ``Hexagons`` grid is constructed as per the examples described in
      the `Rectangular Hexagonal Grid`_ section.

      The grid is assigned the name *hexgrid* so it's result can be reused.

      The ``Location`` command has the following properties:

      - *hexgrid* refers to the assigned name for the ``Hexagons`` grid
      - "0101" contains the co-ordinate of the top-left hexagon in the grid
      - a list, with a shape

      The Location's list contains just one shape |dash| a ``Circle`` which
      will be drawn at the centre of the hexagon matching the co-ordinate
      that has been set.

            [circle(common=a_circle), dot()]
        )

      The ``Hexagons`` grid is constructed as per the examples described in
      the `Rectangular Hexagonal Grid`_ section.

      The grid is assigned the name *hexgrid* so it's result can be reused.

      The ``Location`` command has the following properties:

      - *hexgrid* refers to the assigned name for the ``Hexagons`` grid
      - ``"0101"`` is the co-ordinate of the top-left hexagon in the grid
      - a list of shapes

      The list contains two shapes |dash| a ``Circle`` and a ``Dot``; these
      will be drawn in that order, each at the centre of the hexagon
      matching the co-ordinate that has been set.

`^ <grid locations_>`_

It is often the case that the same shape, or set of shapes, needs to be
displayed at multiple locations within the grid.

.. _linkline-command:

Grid LinkLine
=============
`↑ <table-of-contents-hexg_>`_

The ``LinkLine()`` command allows the creation of a line to join one or more
hexagons within a hexagonal grid.

This command should work with any of the types of hexagonal grid layouts
described above.

All of the examples below make use of the same underlying hexagonal grid:

    .. code:: python

        hexgrid = Hexagons(
            side=0.5,
            x=0, y=0,
            rows=6, cols=4,
            dot=0.02,
            coord_elevation='top'
        )

The grid is assigned the name *hexgrid* so its result can be reused.


Example 1. A Single LinkLine
----------------------------
`^ <Grid LinkLine_>`_

.. |ll0| image:: images/custom/hexagonal_grid/hexgrid_linkline_single.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|ll0| This example shows a ``LinkLine`` constructed using the command:

      .. code:: python

        LinkLine(
            grid=hexgrid,
            locations="0101,0403"
        )

      The ``LinkLine`` command  has the following properties:

      - *grid* used is *hexgrid* (as defined for all these examples)
      - *locations* - set to ``"0101,0403"``

      The *locations* represent the coordinates of the start and end
      locations in the grid, between which the line is drawn.

      By default, the ``Linkline`` uses the *x* and *y* values of the
      centre of the hexagon in which it starts or ends, and uses the
      default styling.

===== ======


Example 2. A Double LinkLine
----------------------------
`^ <Grid LinkLine_>`_

.. |ll1| image:: images/custom/hexagonal_grid/hexgrid_linkline_double.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|ll1| This example shows a ``LinkLine`` constructed using the command:

      .. code:: python

        LinkLine(
            hexgrid,
            "0101,0403,0104"
        )

      The ``LinkLine`` command  has the following properties:

      - the grid used is *hexgrid* (as defined for all these examples)
      - *locations* are set to ``"0101,0403,0104"``

      The string contains the coordinates of multiple start and
      end locations in the grid, between which the line is drawn.

      The first lines is drawn between the first and second hexagon;
      the second between the second and third hexagon specified.

      By default, the ``Linkline`` uses the *x* and *y* values of the
      centre of the hexagon in which it starts or ends, and uses the
      default styling.

      **Note** that in this example, the *grid=* and *locations=* are omitted;
      the program can just use the values presented, provided they are in the
      correct order shown above.

      .. code:: python

        LinkLine(
            hexgrid,
            ["0101", "0403", "0104", "0406"],
            common=Common(
                stroke="tomato",
                stroke_width=2)
        )
        LinkLine(
            hexgrid,
            ["0104", "0406"],
            common=Common(
                stroke="cyan",
                stroke_width=2)
        )

      The ``LinkLine`` commands have the following properties:

      - the grid used is *hexgrid* (as defined for all these examples)
      - ``["0101","0403","0104","0406"]`` - location coordinates
      - ``["0104","0406"]`` - location coordinates
      - *common* - defines the styling for the line

      The location coordinates contain multiple start and end locations in
      the grid, between which the lines are drawn.

      In this example, the locations are defined as individual strings
      in a list.

      By default, the lines use the *x* and *y* values of the centre of the
      hex in which they start or end.

Example 4. An Offset LinkLine
-----------------------------
`^ <Grid LinkLine_>`_

.. |ll3| image:: images/custom/hexagonal_grid/hexgrid_linkline_offset.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|ll3| This example shows a ``LinkLine`` constructed using the command:

      .. code:: python

        LinkLine(
            hexgrid,
            [("0101", 0.25, 0.25),
             ("0403", -0.25, -0.25),
             ("0104", 0.0, 0.25),
             ("0104", 0.25, -0.25)],
            common=Common(
                stroke="tomato",
                stroke_width=1,
                dotted=True)
        )

      The ``LinkLine`` command  has the following properties:

      - the grid used is *hexgrid* (as defined for all these examples)
      - ``("0101", 0.25, 0.25)`` - coordinates of a grid location and the
        **offset** values
      - *common* - this third property defines the styling for the line

      The **offset** values |dash|  *x* and *y*  |dash| are *relative* to
      the centre of the hex in which the line starts or ends.

      Positive values for the offset move the *x* and *y* down and to the
      right of the centre; negatives move the *x* and *y* up and to the
      left of the centre.

      Note that its possible to define the start and end as different offsets
      within the **same** hexagon; as shown here in location ``0104``.

.. _other-hexagonal-resources:

Other Hexagonal Grid Resources
==============================
`↑ <table-of-contents-hexg_>`_

There are already a number of software tools available for creating
hexagonal grids of various kinds and for different purposes.

A few of these tools, some of which are game-specific, for example, the
so-called `18XX <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18XX>`_ series,
are listed below:

-  *HEXGRID* (https://hamhambone.github.io/hexgrid/) - an online hex
   grid generator which interactively creates a display, downloadable as
   a PNG image.
-  *mkhexgrid* (https://www.nomic.net/~uckelman/mkhexgrid/) - a
   command-line program which generates hexagonal grids, used for
   strategy games, as PNG or SVG images.
-  *Hex Map Extension*
   (https://github.com/lifelike/hexmapextension/tree/master) - an
   extension for creating hex grids in *Inkscape* that can also be used
   to make brick patterns of staggered rectangles.
-  *hexboard* (https://www.ctan.org/pkg/hexboard) - a package for LATEX
   that provides functionality for drawing Hex boards and games.
-  *draw_game_board* (https://github.com/jpneto/draw_game_boards/tree/main) -
   a Python tool to translate boards from ASCII format into SVG.
-  *map18xx* (https://github.com/XeryusTC/map18xx) - a 18XX hex map and
   tile generator that outputs to SVG files, scaled to fit A4 paper.
-  *18xx Maker* (https://www.18xx-maker.com/) - uses 18XX game
   definitions written in JSON, displays them, and renders them for
   printing.
-  *ps18xx* (https://github.com/18xx/ps18xx/tree/master) - software for
   running 18XX email games, and creating maps and tile sheets.
-  *LATEX wargame package*
   (https://wargames_tex.gitlab.io/wargame_www/tools.html) - a
   package for LaTeX for authoring hex’n’counter wargames.

The options and facilities provided by these tools have been the primary
inspiration for how hexagonal grids work in **protograf**. If the
functionality available here does not work for you, then possibly one of
these other tools would be of better fit.

The 18XX game series hex maps are often criticised for their poor aesthetic.
