These descriptions of the available shapes assume you are familiar with
the concepts, terms and ideas for :doc:`protograf <index>` as presented
in the :doc:`Basic Concepts <basic_concepts>` - especially *units*,
*properties* and *defaults*. It will also help to at least browse through
the section on :doc:`Additional Concepts <additional_concepts>`.

Overview
---------
`↑ <table-of-contents-core_>`_

Where possible, the basic examples first show how a shape would appear
on a page when **only** the default properties are used. This means that,
for most cases, that *lines* are drawn in **black** and shapes that have an
enclosed area are *filled* with a **white** color. The default length, width
or height in most cases is **1cm**. The only change from default, for these
examples, has been to make the default line width (*stroke_width*) thicker
for easier viewing of the small PNG images.

Most shapes can be styled by setting one or more of the
`Shapes Common Properties`_. Other shapes have additional properties
available that allow even further styling.

To make it easier to see where and how a shape has been drawn, most of these
examples have been created with a background grid, which **protograf**
refers to as a `Blueprint`_ shape, added to the page  - a small A8
"business card" size - for cross-reference. In addition, the default line width
(aka *stroke_width*) has been made thicker for easier viewing of the small
PNG images that were generated from the original PDF output.

.. NOTE::

   The graphics for these examples were generated from either of the following
   scripts;
   `default_shapes <https://github.com/gamesbook/protograf/blob/master/examples/simple/default_shapes.py>`_ or
   `customised_shapes <https://github.com/gamesbook/protograf/blob/master/examples/simple/customised_shapes.py>`_.
   **protograf** first creates a PDF, then generates a PNG file for each page
   in the PDF.

Commonalities
--------------
`↑ <table-of-contents-core_>`_

There are some properties that can be set for almost all of the shapes;
examples of these are presented in the section on `Shapes Common Properties`_
at the end, rather than being described in detail for every single shape.

.. HINT::

   Bear in mind that if a property that it does **not** support is
   provided for a shape, then that property and its value will simply be
   ignored.

.. _linearIndex:

Linear Shapes
--------------
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

.. _arc-command:

Arc
~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

An Arc is a curved line between two points located along the circumference
of a circle.

Example 1. Default Arc
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. |arc| image:: images/defaults/arc.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|arc| This example shows the shape constructed using the command with only
      defaults:

      .. code:: python

          Arc()

      It has the following properties based on the defaults:

      - origin is at x-position ``1`` cm and at y-position ``1`` cm
===== ======

Example 2. Customised Arc
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. |ac2| image:: images/customised/arc.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|ac2| This example shows the shape constructed using the command with these
      properties:

      .. code:: python

          Arc(cx=1, cy=3, radius=2)
          Arc(cx=1, cy=6, radius=2,
              nested=6,
              angle_start=15, angle_width=60)

      To help with visualisation, the top Arc is surrounded by a red Rectangle:

      .. code:: python

            Rectangle(
                x=1, y=1, height=1, width=2, dot=0.02,
                stroke="red", fill=None,
                title="Arc(cx=1, cy=3, radius=2)")
            )

      The top Arc has the following properties:

      - origin is at x-position ``1`` cm and y-position ``3`` cm
      - the arc *radius* is ``2`` cm

      The default arc extent is from 0 |deg| (the line parallel to the
      top edge of the page) to 90 |deg| (the line parallel to the
      side edges of the page).

      The lower Arc has the following properties:

      - origin is at x-position ``1`` cm and y-position ``6`` cm
      - the arc *radius* is ``2`` cm
      - the arc extends from 15 |deg| to 75 |deg|  (ie. *angle_start* of
        15 |deg| + *angle_width* of 60 |deg|)
      - there are ``6`` *nested* arcs equally spaced between the arc
        origin position and the arc itself.

===== ======


.. _bezier-command:

Bezier
~~~~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

A Bezier is a curve that has inflection points, allowing it to "bend".

Example 1. Default Bezier
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. |bez| image:: images/defaults/bezier.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|bez| This example shows the shape constructed using the command with only
      defaults:

      .. code:: python

          Bezier()

      It has the following properties based on the defaults:

      - starts at x-position ``1`` cm and at y-position ``1`` cm
===== ======

Example 2. Customised Bezier
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. |bz1| image:: images/customised/bezier_custom.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|bz1| This example shows the shape constructed using the command with the
      following properties:

      .. code:: python

          Bezier(
            x=0, y=1,
            x1=4, y1=3,
            x2=3, y2=4,
            x3=4, y3=6,
            stroke_width=1)

      It has the following properties based on changes to the defaults:

      - starts at x-position ``0`` cm and at y-position ``1`` cm
      - has the inflection points set by:

        - *x1* and *y1*, and
        - *x2* and *y2*
      - ends at position *x3* of ``4`` cm and at *y3* of ``6`` cm
      - has a thicker *stroke_width*
===== ======

.. _chord-command:

Chord
~~~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

A chord is a straight line joining two points on a circle's diameter.

Example 1. Customised Chord
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. |chd| image:: images/defaults/chord.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|chd| If the shape constructed using only default properties, there will be
      nothing to see:

      .. code:: python

          Chord()

      This example then shows the shape constructed using the command with these
      properties:

      .. code:: python

          Chord(
              shape=Circle(radius=1, fill=None),
              angle=135,
              angle1=45)

      It has the following properties based on these values:

      - a small circle that defines boundaries for the chord line
      - the start of chord is at the intersection of the radius of the circle
        at 135 |deg| with the circle's circumference
      - the end of chord is at the intersection of the radius of the circle
        at 45 |deg| with the circle's circumference

===== ======

.. _dot-command:

Dot
~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

A Dot shape is essentially a very small, pre-filled `Circle`_.

Example 1. Default Dot
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. |dot| image:: images/defaults/dot.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|dot| This example shows the shape constructed using the command with only
      defaults:

      .. code:: python

          Dot()

      It has the following properties based on the defaults:

      - top-left at x-position ``1`` cm and at y-position ``1`` cm
      - diameter of ``3`` points; there are 72 points in an inch, so this is
        1/24th of an inch, or approximately ``1`` mm (``0.1`` cm), in size
      - fill color for a Dot is the same as the stroke |dash| default is black

      The default diameter for a Dot can be changed by setting its *dot_width*
      which, like *stroke_width* for Text, is in point units.

===== ======


.. _line-command:

Line
~~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

.. NOTE::

   There is more detail about the many properties that can be defined for a
   Line in the :ref:`customised Line <lineIndex>` section.


Example 1. Default Line
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. |ln1| image:: images/defaults/line.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|ln1| This example shows the shape constructed using the command with only
      defaults:

      .. code:: python

          Line()

      It has the following properties based on the defaults:

      - starts at x-position ``1`` cm and at y-position ``1`` cm
      - length of ``1`` cm
      - heading/default direction is 0 |deg| |dash| i.e. "eastwards"

      *Note* that direction means "anti-clockwise from 0 |deg|", where
      the zero lines runs in the "east" direction from the left.
===== ======


.. _polyline-command:

Polyline
~~~~~~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

A Polyline is a series of one or more lines joining two or more points.

In addition to setting points directly, the Polyline can also be constructed
using the *steps* property.  This define a series of values that represent
the **relative** distance from the last point drawn.

The following examples illustrate these properties:

- `Example 1. Basic Polyline`_
- `Example 2. Customised Polyline`_
- `Example 3. Polyline with Arrow`_
- `Example 4. Polyline with Snail`_


Example 1. Basic Polyline
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
`^ <polyline-command_>`_

.. |py1| image:: images/defaults/polyline.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|py1| The shape cannot be constructed using only default properties:

      .. code:: python

          Polyline()

      Nothing will be visible; instead you will see a warning::

        WARNING:: There are no points to draw the Polyline

      The upper example then shows the shape constructed using the command with
      these properties:

      .. code:: python

          Polyline(points=[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0)])

      It has the following properties based on these values:

      - starts at x-position ``0`` cm and at y-position ``0`` cm
      - second point is at x-position ``1`` cm and at y-position ``1`` cm
      - third point is at x-position ``2`` cm and at y-position ``0`` cm

      The *points* for a Polyline are in a list, as shown by the square
      brackets from ``[`` to ``]``, where:

      - each *x* and *y* are provided as a pair of values in round brackets
      - each *x* and *y* are separated by a comma
      - each pair of values in the list is separated by a comma

===== ======


Example 2. Customised Polyline
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
`^ <polyline-command_>`_

.. |py2| image:: images/customised/polyline_basic.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|py2| The upper example shows the shape constructed using the command with
      these properties:

      .. code:: python

        Polyline(
          points=[(1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)],
          stroke_width=1, stroke="red")

      Here the points are arranged so as to create a basic 'house' outline.

      The lower example also shows how to create a Polyline using the command
      with these properties:

      .. code:: python

        Polyline(
          x=1, y=3, stroke_width=1,
          steps='0.5,0 0,1.5 1.5,0 0,-1.5 0.5,0 0,0.5 -2.5,0')

      Here, the *steps* property results in the drawing of an outline
      using a series of distances |dash| or offsets |dash| from the last
      point.  The start is provided by the *x* and *y* values.

      Each pair of comma-separated values are x- and y-distances
      respectively.

===== ======


Example 3. Polyline with Arrow
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
`^ <polyline-command_>`_

.. |py3| image:: images/customised/polyline_arrow.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|py3| The shape is constructed with these properties:

      .. code:: python

        Polyline(
            points=[(1,3), (2,4), (2.5,2), (3,3), (3.5,1)],
            stroke_width=1,
            arrow=True
        )
        Polyline(
            points=[(1,5), (3,5)],
            stroke_width=1,
            dotted=True,
            arrow_style='notch',
            arrow_double=True
        )

      This example makes use of the "arrow" properties available for a line.

      For more details on how arrows are used and set, see the
      :ref:`Line with Arrow <line-with-arrow>` example.

===== ======


Example 4. Polyline with Snail
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
`^ <polyline-command_>`_

The *snail* property is loosely based on the Turtle graphics drawing module
available for Python (see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).

Instead of using points, the idea of the *snail* is to create a polyline
based on a series of lines of given length, where the line direction |dash|
or orientation |dash| will already have been set.   Each line is then drawn
from the end point of the previous line.

A *snail* property consists of a series of terms, each separated by a space.
Each term either relates to a direction change or to drawing a line of a
certain length.

Directions can be set as follows:

- a *compass direction*: one of n, e, w, s, ne, se, sw, or nw
- an **absolute** *angle*: an ``a`` followed by a value in degrees, from
  0 to 360, measured counter-clockwise from the east direction
- a **relative** angle:

  - a ``r`` or ``-`` sign (followed by a value in degrees): will *decrease*
    the current angle i.e. alter it in a clockwise direction
  - a ``l`` or ``+`` sign (followed by a value in degrees): will *increase*
    the current angle i.e. alter it in an anti-clockwise direction

Creating a line is done as follows:

- a normal value |dash| whole or fractional |dash| will draw a line that
  distance, in the last direction that was set
- using a ``**`` will draw a line from the current point back to the start

Moving - **without** creating a line - is done as follows:

- a **relative** amount: a ``j`` followed by a value which is the distance,
  at which the new point will be set |dash| according to the last direction
  that was set; no line will be dreawn between the points.
- a **fixed point** move: a ``*`` will set the next, new point to match the
  one at the start; no line will be dreawn between the points.

.. NOTE::

    The *snail* line always starts at the x- and y-point defined for the
    Polyline; and the starting direction is "e" or 0 |deg|.  The first term
    in the *snail* property can either be a direction or a distance.


.. raw:: html

   <small>Apologies for using "jump" as the term to cause a move to
   happen without drawing a line; the idea of a snail jumping was just
   too absurd not to use!</small>


.. |py4| image:: images/customised/polyline_snail.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|py4| The Polyline shape is constructed with these properties:

      .. code:: python

        snail_line = "n 3 e 2 -45 2 w 1 sw 3 **"
        Polyline(
            y=0.5,
            snail="2 s 1 w 2 n 1",
            stroke_width=2,
            stroke="red")
        Polyline(
            x=0, y=5,
            snail=snail_line,
            stroke_width=1)
        Polyline(
            x=0, y=5,
            snail=snail_line,
            stroke_width=1,
            scaling=0.5)
        Polyline(
            x=3.5, y=1,
            snail="s 0.4 j0.1 "*8,
            stroke_width=1,
            stroke="green")
        Polyline(
            y=3, x=2,
            snail="e 1 s 1 w 1 n 1 s j1 "*3,
            stroke_width=2,
            stroke="blue")

      The top example is a simple red line going in a square.  It starts by
      going east |dash| the default direction |dash| for ``2cm`` then south
      for ``1cm``, west for ``2cm`` and finally north for ``1cm``.

      The two examples with the black lines share the same *snail* line,
      assigned to ``snail_line``.  This example shows the use of the ``-``
      to represent turning right, in this case by 45 |deg|.  It also shows
      how the ``**`` term constructs a line back to the start.  The "smaller"
      example is constructed using the *scaling* fraction |dash| in this case
      set to ``0.5`` to make it half the size. Note that both lines have the
      same starting point.

      The example with the green line shows how a dotted line can be
      constructed using the "jump" (``j``) term to create a space in the same
      direction as the drawn line.  The ``*8`` then repeats the snail line
      eight times |dash| actually, the full string get constructed by joining
      eight copies of this same string, so that is why a space is needed at
      the end.

      The example with the blue line shows how a shape |dash| in this case a
      square |dash| is constructed multiple times using the `*3`` to
      repeat the outline three times. Again, the "jump" (``j``) term is used
      to move to a different location before the next shape is drawn. Note
      that start direction is set explicitly, rather than using a default!


===== ======

.. _text-command:

Text
~~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

It may seem strange to view text as a "shape" but, from a drawing point of
view, it's really just a series of complex lines drawn in a particular pattern!
Thus text has a position in common with many other shapes, along with *stroke*
to set its line color, as well as its own special properties.

The basic properties that can be set are:

- *text* - the text string to be displayed
- *font_size* - default is ``12`` points
- *font_name* - the default is ``Helvetica``
- *stroke* - the default text color is ``black``
- *align* - the default alignment is ``centre``; it can be changed to be
  ``left`` or ``right``

.. NOTE::

   There is more detail about the various properties that can be defined for
   Text in the :ref:`customised text <table-of-contents-text>`
   doc.


Example 1. Default Text
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. |t01| image:: images/defaults/text.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|t01| This example shows the shape constructed using the command with mostly
      defaults.

      Only the *text* property is changed from a blank string |dash| otherwise
      there would nothing to see!

      .. code:: python

          Text(text="Hello World")

      It otherwise has the following properties based on the defaults:

      - located is at x-position ``1`` cm and at y-position ``1`` cm
      - text is at the ``center`` of the position
      - default *font_size* is ``12`` points
      - default *font_name* is ``Helvetica``

===== ======


Enclosed Shapes
---------------
`↑ <table-of-contents-core_>`_

These shapes are created by enclosing an area, the most basic being a simple rectangle.
They effectively have two dimensions: *height* and *width*.

The difference between enclosed and linear shapes is that the area enclosed by
the shape can be filled with a color. The default fill color is *white*.
There is an overview on how color is used in the
:doc:`Basic Concepts section <basic_concepts>`

.. HINT:::

   **protograf** comes with a predefined set of named colors, shown in the
   `colors <https://github.com/gamesbook/protograf/blob/master/examples/colorset.pdf>`_
   PDF file.


.. _arrow-command:

Arrow
~~~~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

An Arrow consists of two main parts: the tail (or body) and the head.  In terms
of **protograf** conventions, the tail is the part that takes on the common
properties of *height* and *width*; while the dimensions for the head, if not
provided, are calculated from those.

Example 1. Default Arrow
++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. |ar0| image:: images/defaults/arrow.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|ar0| This example shows the shape constructed using the command with only
      defaults:

      .. code:: python

          Arrow()

      It has the following properties based on the defaults:

      - centre-bottom point at x-position ``1`` cm and at y-position ``1`` cm
      - *height* of the tail portion of ``1`` cm
      - *head_height* of the head portion of ``1`` cm (based on the *height*)
      - *head_width* of the head portion of ``2`` cm; the maximum distance
        between the two arrowhead "wingtips" - for which the default value is
        calculated as equal to twice the *width*
===== ======

Example 2. Rotated Arrow
++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. |ar1| image:: images/customised/arrow_rotate.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|ar1| This example shows the shape constructed using the commands as follows:

      .. code:: python

        Arrow(
            x=1, y=5.5,
            title="The Arrow", heading="An arrow",
            dot=0.1, cross=0.5)

        Arrow(
            x=2.5, y=3, title="0\u00B0",
            dot=0.15, dotted=True)

        Arrow(
            x=2.5, y=3, title="45\u00B0",
            dot=0.1, dot_stroke="red",
            fill=None, stroke="red", rotation=45)

        Arrow(
            x=3, y=5.5,
            label="arrow")

      The shapes all set the following properties:

      - centre-bottom point at *x* and *y*
      - *title* - appears below the shape
      - *dot* - small, filled circle |dash| **centre** of the
        Arrow

      The lower-left Arrow also sets the following properties:

      - *heading* - appears above the shape
      - *cross* - small pair of lines at the Arrow's centre

      The lower-right Arrow also sets the following properties:

      - *label* - appears in the middle of the shape

      The two arrows in the top-right are superimposed.

      The red outline Arrow shares the same centre as the black dotted
      Arrow before/below it.

      The red arrow is rotated 45 |deg| to the left about the centre.

      .. NOTE::

         The degrees sign is a Unicode character i.e. a "\\u" followed by four
         numbers and/or letters.

===== ======
|ar2| This example shows the shape constructed using the commands as follows:

      .. code:: python

        Arrow(
            x=1, y=5, height=1, width=0.5,
            head_height=0.5, head_width=0.75)
        Arrow(
            x=2, y=5, height=1, width=0.5,
            head_height=0.5, head_width=0.75,
            tail_width=0.75,
            stroke="tomato", fill="lightsteelblue",
            stroke_width=2, transparency=50)
        Arrow(
            x=3, y=5, height=1, width=0.5,
            head_height=0.5, head_width=0.75,
            tail_width=0.01,
            fill_stroke="gold")
        Arrow(
            x=1, y=3, height=1, width=0.25,
            head_height=0.5, head_width=1,
            points_offset=-0.25,
            fill="chartreuse")
        Arrow(
            x=2, y=3, height=1, width=0.25,
            head_height=1, head_width=0.75,
            points_offset=0.25,
            fill="tomato")
        Arrow(
            x=3, y=3, height=1, width=0.5,
            head_height=0.5, head_width=0.5,
            tail_notch=0.25,
            stroke="black", fill="cyan", stroke_width=1)

      The shapes all set the following properties:

      - centre-bottom point at *x* and *y*
      - *height* of the tail portion (``1`` cm for all)
      - *width* of the tail portion
      - *head_height* sets height of the head (triangular) portion
      - *head_width* sets width of the head (triangular) portion

      The *head_width* represents the maximum distance between the outer
      arrowhead "wingtips".

      The **silver** arrow has these properties:

      - *tail_width* of ``0.75`` cm
      - *transparency* - set to ``50`` %; the grid is partly visible through it

      The smaller *tail_width* means the base of the arrow is wider
      than the body i.e. the width at the top of the tail section.

      The **gold** arrow has these properties:

      - *tail_width* of ``0.01`` cm

      The near-zero *tail_width*  means the base of the arrow is nearly
      shown as a point.

      The **green** (``chartreuse`` fill) arrow has these properties:

      - *points_offset* of ``-0.25`` cm

      The *points_offset* here means that the two "wingtips" of the arrowhead
      are moved back towards the tail.

      The **red** (``tomato`` fill)  arrow has these properties:

      - *points_offset* of ``0.25`` cm;

      The *points_offset* here means that the two "wingtips" of the arrowhead
      are moved forwards away from the tail.

      In this case, the head has been been made narrower and longer.

      The **blue** (``cyan`` fill) arrow has these properties:

      - *tail_notch* of ``0.25`` cm; the base has a small inwards-facing
        triangle "cut out"

      The blue arrow also has matching *width* and *head_width* (of ``0.5`` cm)
      which means that there are no visible arrowhead "wingtips".

      It has the following properties set for it:

      - centre at x-position ``2`` cm and at y-position ``3`` cm
      - *height* of ``4`` cm
      - *width* of ``3`` cm

      Because the *height* is greater than the *width* it has more of an egg-shape.

      - starting position - *x* is ``1`` cm and *y* is ``4`` cm
      - *side* of ``1.5`` cm; all sides are equal
      - *hatches_count* of ``5`` - this means there will be 5 equally spaced lines drawn
        between opposing sides and running parallel to the third side
      - *hatches_stroke* - customise the hatches to show them as ``red``

      The top section shows:

.. _polygon-command:

Polygon
~~~~~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

A polygon is a shape constructed of any number of sides of equal length.

For example, a hexagon is simply a polygon with 6 sides and an octagon
is a polygon with 8 sides.

    **HINT** Unlike the `Hexagon`_ shape, a Polygon can be rotated!

The following examples


Example 1. Default Polygon
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
`^ <polygon-command_>`_

.. |pol| image:: images/defaults/polygon.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|pol| This example shows the shape constructed using the command with only
      defaults:

      .. code:: python

          Polygon()

      It has the following properties based on the defaults:

      - centre at x-position ``1`` cm and at y-position ``1`` cm
      - ``6`` sides
      - a *side* length of  ``1`` cm
===== ======

Example 2. Polygon with Sides
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
`^ <polygon-command_>`_

.. |pl1| image:: images/customised/polygon_sizes.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|pl1| This example shows three shapes constructed using the command with the
      following properties:

      .. code:: python

        Polygon(
            cx=1, cy=5, sides=7,
            radius=1, label="Seven")
        Polygon(
            cx=2, cy=3, sides=6,
            radius=1, label="Six")
        Polygon(
            cx=3, cy=1, sides=5,
            radius=1, label="Five")

      It can be seen that each shape is constructed as follows:

      - *centre* - using *cx* and *cy* values
      - *radius* - ``1`` cm in each case
      - *sides* - varying from ``7`` down to ``5``

      Even-sided polygons have a "flat" top, whereas odd-sided ones are
      asymmetrical; this can be adjusted through `rotation`_.

|pl2| This example shows the shape constructed using the command with the
      additional properties.

      The **lower** example:

      .. code:: python

          Polygon(
              cx=2, cy=4, sides=8, radius=1,
              radii=True)

      It has the following properties:

      - *centre* at x-position ``2`` cm and at y-position ``4`` cm, with a *radius*
        size of ``1`` cm
      - *sides* - ``8`` sides
      - *radii* - set to ``True`` to force lines to be drawn from the centre
        of the polygon to each of its vertices

      The **top** example:

      .. code:: python

          Polygon(
              cx=2, cy=1, sides=10, radius=1,
              radii=True,
              radii_offset=0.75,
              radii_length=0.25,
              radii_stroke_width=1,
              dot=0.1, dot_stroke="red"
          )

      It has the following properties:

      - *centre* at x-position ``2`` cm and at y-position ``1`` cm, with a *radius*
        size of ``1`` cm
      - *sides* - ``10``
      - *radii* - set to ``True`` to force lines to be drawn from the centre of
        the polygon to each of its vertices; the radii properties are then set:

        - *radii_offset* - set to ``0.75`` cm; distance away from the centre
          that the radii will start
        - *radii_length*  - set to ``0.25`` cm
        - *radii_stroke_width* - set to ``1`` point; a slightly thicker line

      .. NOTE::

        When the radii length is shorter than the distance from
        vertex to centre, the line will still go in the same direction
        but never touch the vertex.

===== ======

Example 4. Polygon with Perbii
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
`^ <polygon-command_>`_

The *perbii* |dash| "perbis" is short for "perpendicular bisector" and "perbii"
is the plural form |dash| defines lines that should be drawn from the centres
of the sides of the polygon to the polygon's centre.

.. |pl3| image:: images/customised/polygon_perbii.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|pl3| This example shows the shape constructed using the command with the
      additional properties.

      The **lower** example:

      .. code:: python

          Polygon(
              cx=2, cy=4, sides=8,
              radius=1, perbii='*')

      It has the following properties:

      - *centre* at x-position ``2`` cm and at y-position ``4`` cm, with a *radius*
        size of ``1`` cm
      - *sides* - ``8`` sides (an octagon)
      - *perbii* - set to ``*``; this means lines are drawn from each of the
        centres of the sides of the polygon to its centre

      The **top** example:

      .. code:: python

          Polygon(
            cx=2, cy=1, sides=8, radius=1,
            perbii="2,4,7",
            perbii_offset=0.25,

            perbii_stroke_width=1,
            dot=0.1, dot_stroke="red")

      It has the following properties:

      - *centre* at x-position ``2`` cm and at y-position ``1`` cm
      - *radius* size of ``1`` cm
      - *sides* - ``8`` (an octagon)
      - *perbii* - lines drawn to sides 2, 4 and 7

      The edges of the polygon are numbered; the east-most facing edge is 1,
      and then numbers increase in an clockwise direction.

      Its properties can be set as follows:

      - *perbii* - a list of edges to use
      - *perbii_offset* - set to ``0.25`` cm; the distance away from the centre
        that the lines will start to be drawn
      - *perbii_length*  - set to ``0.5`` cm
      - *perbii_stroke_width* - set to ``1`` point; a slightly thicker line

      Note that when the *perbii length* is shorter than that the distance from
      centre point to edge, the line will still go in the same direction but
      never touch the vertex or the edge.

            common=poly6,
            cy=5, cx=3.0,
            rotation=60, label="60")

      The examples have the following properties:

      - *common* - set shared diameter, sides and fill for all Polygons
      - *cx* and *cy* - set the centre location for the Polygon
      - *radius* - ``1`` cm in each case
      - *sides* - the default of ``6`` in each case (a `hexagon`_ shape)
      - *rotation* - varies from 0 |deg| to 60 |deg|

      The rotation defined here is anti-clockwise from the horizontal.

Example 6. Polygon Slices
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
`^ <polygon-command_>`_

Slices are a set of colors that are drawn as triangles inside a
a Polygon in a clockwise direction starting from the "South East".
If there are fewer colors than all the possible triangles, then the
colors are repeated, starting from the first one.

                    'aqua', 'pink', 'violet', 'purple'])

      This example has the following properties:

      - *cx* and *cy* - set the centre location
      - *radius* - ``1`` cm
      - *sides* - set to ``8`` (an octagon)
      - *slices* - list of named colors that will be drawn
        seqentially

.. _polyshape-command:

Polyshape
~~~~~~~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

A Polyshape is an irregular `polygon`_, constructed using a series of points.

It's basic setup and construction  shares much in common with the
`Polyline <polyline-command_>`_ but with  some differences, such as its
*fill* and centre properties.

The following examples illustrate these properties:

- `Example 1. Default Polyshape`_
- `Example 2. Polyshape: Centre and Steps`_
- `Example 3. Polyshape Offset`_
- `Example 4. Polyshape with Snail`_


Example 1. Default Polyshape
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
`^ <polyshape-command_>`_

.. |shp| image:: images/customised/polyshape_default.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|shp| If the shape is constructed using the command with only defaults:

      .. code:: python

        Polyshape()

      Then nothing will be visible; instead you will see a warning::

        WARNING:: There are no points to draw the Polyshape

      Like `polyline`_, the Polyshape requires a list of points to be constructed.

      This example shows how to do this using the command with these properties:

      .. code:: python

        Polyshape(
          points=[
              (1, 2),
              (1, 1),
              (2, 0),
              (3, 1),
              (3, 2)])

      It has the following properties:

      - starts at x-position ``1`` cm and y-position ``2`` cm
      - second point is at x-position ``1`` cm and y-position ``1`` cm
      - third point is at x-position ``2`` cm and y-position ``0`` cm
      - etc.

      The *points* for a Polyshape which represent its vertices are given in a
      list:

      - all points are listed inside the square brackets from ``[`` to ``]``
      - each *x* and *y* are provided as a pair of values in round brackets
      - each *x* and *y* are separated by a comma
      - each pair of values in the list is separated by a comma

      Lines are drawn between each successive point in the list; **including a
      line from the last to the first**.

      The default *stroke* and *fill* apply to this example of a Polyshape.

Example 2. Polyshape: Centre and Steps
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
`^ <polyshape-command_>`_

While the Polyshape does not have the ability to be constructed using a
*cx* and *cy* pair to set its centre location |dash| like the symmetric
shapes |dash| it is possible to provide these values to the shape command,
and they can then be used for a label, plus the `dot and cross`_, similar
to those other shapes.

**NOTE** - the program has no way of knowing or "checking" that the values
for the *cx* and *cy* pair that you supply to it are correct!

In addition to setting points directly, the Polyshape can also be constructed
using the *steps* property.  This define a series of values that represent
the **relative** distance from the last point drawn.


.. |sh2| image:: images/customised/polyshape_custom.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|sh2| The shape is constructed using the command with these properties:

      .. code:: python

        Polyshape(
            points=[(1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)],
            cx=2, cy=1,
            label='A House',
            label_stroke="seagreen",
            cross=0.5,
            fill="sandybrown",
            stroke="peru",
        )

      As in Example 1, the *points* are used to construct the outline of the
      "house" shape. Other properties:

      - the centre is *defined* to be at x-position ``2`` cm and y-position
        ``1`` cm
      - *cross* - sets the length of each of the two lines that cross at the
        centre to be ``0.5`` cm
      - *label* - sets the text appearing at the defined centre position
      - *fill* - color of ``sandybrown`` (hexadecimal value ``#F4A460``)
        for the shape's' interior
      - *stroke* - color of ``peru`` (hexadecimal value ``#CD853F``)

      *Reminder:* ``cx`` and ``cy`` affect the drawing of the cross and label
      but do **not** affect the drawing of the shape itself.

      The lower shape shows how create a Polyshape using the command with
      these properties:

      .. code:: python

        Polyshape(
          x=1, y=3,
          steps='0.5,0 0,1.5 1.5,0 0,-1.5 0.5,0 0,0.5 -2.5,0 0,-0.5',
          stroke="sandybrown",
          stroke_width=3,
          fill="seagreen")

      Here, the *steps* property results in the drawing of an outline
      using a series of distances |dash| or offsets |dash| from the last
      point.  The start is provided by the *x* and *y* values.

      Each pair of comma-separated values are x- and y-distances
      respectively.

===== ======

Example 3. Polyshape Offset
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
`^ <polyshape-command_>`_

There are two other options available.

In addition to the *cx* and *cy* pair, an *x* and *y* pair can also be provided;
these values will be used to offset ("move") the Polyshape from the position it
would normally occupy.

It is also possible to provide the *points* as a string of space-separated
pairs of values; so instead of ``[(0,0), (1,1)]`` just use ``"0,0 1,1"``.

.. |sh3| image:: images/customised/polyshape_offset.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|sh3| The Polyshapes are constructed using the command with these properties:

        .. code:: python

            Polyshape(
                points="0,0 0,1 2,0 2,1 0,0",
                cx=1, cy=0.5,
                fill="chartreuse",
                label="Left ....... Right")
            Polyshape(
                points="0,0 0,1 2,0 2,1 0,0",
                cx=1, cy=0.5,
                fill="gold",
                label="Left ....... Right",
                x=1, y=2)

      As in Example 2, the *points* are used to construct the outline of the
      shape. In this case, they are a string of space-separated pairs of values.

      Other properties:

      - the centre is defined to be at x-position ``1`` cm and y-position
        ``0.5`` cm; this **only** affects drawing of the label
        but does **not** affect drawing the shape itself
      - *label* - sets the text appearing at the defined centre position
      - *fill* color defines the color of the interior of the shape

      In the ``gold``-filled Polyshape, the *x* and *y* values have been set.
      So, even though the points used to define the ``gold`` Polyshape are
      the same as those used for ``green`` one, these values cause the whole
      shape to be moved down and to the right.

===== ======


Example 4. Polyshape with Snail
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
`^ <polyshape-command_>`_

The *snail* property is loosely based on the Turtle graphics drawing module
available for Python (see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).

Instead of using points, the idea of the *snail* is to create a Polyshape
based on a series of lines of given length, where the line direction |dash|
or orientation |dash| will already have been set.   Each line is then drawn
from the end point of the previous line.

A *snail* property consists of a series of terms, each separated by a space.
Each term either relates to a direction change or to drawing a line of a
certain length.

Directions can be set as follows:

- a *compass direction*: one of n, e, w, s, ne, se, sw, or nw
- an **absolute** *angle*: an ``a`` followed by a value in degrees, from
  0 to 360, measured counter-clockwise from the east direction
- a **relative** angle:

  - a ``r`` or ``-`` sign (followed by a value in degrees): will *decrease*
    the current angle i.e. alter it in a clockwise direction
  - a ``l`` or ``+`` sign (followed by a value in degrees): will *increase*
    the current angle i.e. alter it in an anti-clockwise direction

Creating a line is done as follows:

- a normal value |dash| whole or fractional |dash| will draw a line that
  distance, in the last direction that was set
- using a ``**`` will draw a line from the current point back to the start

.. NOTE::

    The *snail* line always starts at the x- and y-point defined for the
    Polyshape; and the starting direction is "e" or 0 |deg|.  The first term
    in the *snail* property can either be a direction or a distance.

    Unlike the Polyline *snail*, no "jump" type movement is allowed; there
    must be a continuous line.

.. |sh4| image:: images/customised/polyshape_snail.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|sh4| The Polyshapes are constructed using the command with these properties:

      .. code:: python

        Polyshape(
            x=0.5, y=1.5,
            snail="ne 1 r65 1 ne 1.5 r125 1.44 **",
            stroke_width=1,
            #scaling=0.25,
            stroke="red",
            fill="tan")
        Polyshape(
            x=1, y=2.5,
            snail="2 r160 "*9,
            stroke_width=0.5,
            #scaling=0.25,
            stroke="red",
            fill="yellow")
        Polyshape(
            x=1.5, y=4,
            snail='w .5 s .5 e 2.5 n .5 w .5 s 1.5 w 1.5 n .5',
            stroke="sandybrown",
            stroke_width=3,
            fill="seagreen")
        Polyshape(
            x=2, y=4.75,
            snail='w .5 s .5 e 2.5 n .5 w .5 s 1.5 w 1.5 n .5',
            scaling=0.25,
            stroke="sandybrown",
            stroke_width=1,
            fill="seagreen")


      The top example ilustrates the use of the ``r`` term to change the angle
      of the line to the "right" of the direction it was aimed at before (north
      east, in the first case). It also shows how the ``**`` term constructs a
      line back to the start.

      The middle example |dash| based on the one shown for the Turtle |dash|
      shows how a simple move-and-turn can be repeated multiple times (using
      the ``*`` multiplier to make copies) to construct a more complex shape.

      The lower example is a repeat of the one shown for
      `Example 2. Polyshape: Centre and Steps`_ but constructed with simple
      compass directions.  It may not be that much shorter, but it could be
      clearer.  In addition it can easily be scaled, as can be seen from the
      small "inset" shape - the same *snail* but shrunk in size using
      ``scaling=0.25``.

.. _qrcode-command:

QRCode
~~~~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

A QR Code is a square image containing a pattern of black squares and dots.
It represents encoded information that a device with a QR scanner, for example
a cell phone, can decode.

The properties that can be provided to a ``QRCode`` command, apart from the
usual *x* and *y*, to set the upper-left corner, and *height* and *width* to
set the size, are:

- *image* - this should be the first property and is the name of the file
  that will be created by the command
- *text* - this contains the information that is to be encoded (and decoded)
- *scaling* - the size of the indivdual QR Code squares, in pixels
- *stroke* - the color of the pattern containing the black squares and dots
- *fill* - the color that will appear as the background

.. NOTE::

    The QR Code images generated will be stored in the cache directory
    ``.protograf/images/qrcodes`` (or ``.protograf\images\qrcodes``);
    see :ref:`caching <protograf_caching>`.


Example 1. Default QRCode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. |qrc| image:: images/customised/qr_code.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|qrc| The shape cannot be constructed using only default properties:

      .. code:: python

          QRCode()

      Nothing will be visible; instead you will see a warning::

        WARNING:: No text supplied for the QRCode shape!

      This example shows the shape constructed using the commands with these
      properties:

      .. code:: python

        QRCode("qrcode1.png", text="Help")

      The first command uses the defaults which means it has the following
      properties automtically set for it:

      - upper-left corner at x-position ``1`` cm and at y-position ``1`` cm
      - *width* and *height* - default to ``1`` cm
      - *scaling* - default is ``1``, so 1 pixel per square
      - *stroke* - is ``black`` for the squares color
      - *fill* - is ``white`` for the background color

      The second command overides various of these defaults:

      .. code:: python

        QRCode(
            'qrcode2.png',
            text="Help me ObiWan",
            x=1, y=3,
            height=2, width=2,
            fill="gray",
            stroke="red",
            scaling=5
        )

      In this example, the QR Code is now larger with different colors.

      It has the following properties set for it:

      - upper-left corner at x-position ``1`` cm and y-position ``1`` cm
      - *width* and *height* - default to ``1`` cm

      Because all sides of the Rectangle are equal, it appears as though it
      is a `Square`_.

      It has the following properties set for it:

      - *cx* and *cy* - set the centre at x-position ``2`` cm and
        y-position ``3`` cm
      - *height* - ``4`` cm
      - *width* - ``3`` cm
      - *dot* - small, filled circle placed at the centre of size ``0.1``

      Because the *height* is greater than the *width* the Rectangle has an
      appearance like a playing card.

          )

      It has the following properties set for it:

      - centre at x-position ``2`` cm and at y-position ``3`` cm
      - *width* of ``2`` cm
      - *height* of ``3`` cm
      - *borders* - a list of sets of custom settings for each side; each set
        can contain:

        - `direction` - ne (northeast), se (southeast), nw (northwest),
          or sw (southwest)
        - `width` - the line thickness
        - `color` - either a named color or a hexadecimal value
        - `style` - ``True`` makes it dotted; a pair of values creates dashes

        Direction and width are required, but color and style are optional.

        Mutiple, spaced values can be used to draw lines e.g. ``ne se``.

.. _sector-command:

Sector
~~~~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

A Sector is like the triangular-shaped wedge that is often cut from a pizza
or cake. It extends from the centre of a "virtual" circle outwards to its
enclosing diameter.  The two "arms" of the sector will cover a certain number
of degrees of the circle (from 1 to 360).

      It has the following properties based on the defaults:

      - upper-left "corner"at x-position ``1`` cm and at y-position ``1`` cm

      The sector is then drawn inside a circle of radius ``1`` cm, whose
      centre is at  x-position ``0.5`` cm and at y-position ``0.5`` cm.
      The default *angle_width* is 90 |deg|.

      to allow multiple Sectors to share the same properties.

      .. code:: python

        sctm = Common(
            cx=2, cy=3, radius=2,
            fill="black", angle_width=43)

        Sector(common=sctm, angle=40)
        Sector(common=sctm, angle=160)
        Sector(common=sctm, angle=280)

      These all have the following Common properties:

      - centred at x-position ``2`` cm and at y-position ``3`` cm
      - *radius* of ``2`` cm for the enclosing "virtual" circle
      - *fill* color of black
      - *angle_width* - determines the coverage i.e. the "width" of the
        Sector; in all these cases it is 43 |deg|

      Each sector in this example is drawn at a different *angle*.
      This represents a "virtual" centre-line extending through the sector,
      outwards from the centre of the enclosing "virtual" circle.

      - *edges* - set the projection direction(s)

      The edges of the rounded projection(s) can be set using
      a letter to represent direction, where:

      - ``n`` is ``north`` ("up"),
      - ``s`` is ``south`` ("down"),
      - ``e`` is ``east`` ("right"), and
      - ``w`` is ``west`` ("left").

      One or more edge values can be used together with spaces between them
      e.g. ``n e`` to draw both north **and** east.

.. _star-command:

Star
~~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

A Star is a multi-pointed shape; essentially made by joining points spaced
equally around the circumference of an outer circle to points spaced
equally around the circumference of a smaller "inner" circle.

To create other kinds of stars, see the "triangle" or "sun" petal shapes
that can be created using a :ref:`customised Circle <circleIndex>`.

Properties
++++++++++

A Star shape has the following additional properties:

- *rays* - number of arms of the Star; defaults to ``5``
- *inner_fraction* - used to calulate the inner circle on which the other
  points used to draw the Star are placed; as this gets smaller, the width
  of the arms gets narrower; defaults to ``0.5`` (one-half)
- *show_radii* - if ``True``, then lines are drawn from the Star centre
  to all of the points (inner and outer); default is ``False``
- *slices* - a list of color values that will be used to color the triangles
  formed between the centre and the points of the rays

      The Star has the following properties based on the defaults:

      - centre at x-position ``1`` cm and at y-position ``1`` cm
      - default *radius* of ``1`` cm
      - default of ``5`` *rays*

             rays=12,
             inner_fraction=0.1,
        )

      These have the following properties that differ from the defaults:

      - centre defined at *cx* and  *cy*-position in cm
      - *radius* - ``1`` cm; length of the "rays" from centre to outer points

      The upper Star has the default number of *rays* i.e. ``5``, plus:

      - *fill* color - ``red`` for the interior of the Star
      - *stroke* color - ``yellow`` for the outline of the Star
      - *stroke_width*  - ``2`` for the line thickness of the outline of the Star
      - *inner_fraction* - changed to ``0.4``; which cause the lines to
        appear to "flatten" and align

      The middle Star has:

      - *rays* - changed to ``6``
      - *show_radii* - if ``True``, then lines are drawn from the Star centre
        to all of the points (inner and outer)
      - *rotation* - 30 |deg| anti-clockwise about the centre

      The lower Star has:

      - *rays* - changed to ``12``
      - *inner_fraction* - changed to ``0.1``; which causes the "spiky"
        appearance

                "#F7C615",
            ]
        )

      The upper Star has the following changes:

      - *rays* - changed to ``4``
      - *inner_fraction* - changed to ``0.33``; which makes rays more "spiky"
      - *dot* -  a small red dot is drawn in the centre of the Star
      - *slices* - only two colors are provided in the list, so they will be
        reused across all the rays

      The lower Star has the default number of *rays* i.e. ``5``, plus:

      - *slices* - the list contains a unique color for each triangle.

      **NOTE** that the coloring for the triangles starts in the righthand
      side of the "top" triangle |dash| by default, a Star's rays always start
      from 90 |deg|, or "north".

.. _starfield-command:

Starfield
~~~~~~~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

A Starfield is a shape in which a number of small dots are scattered at random
to simulate what might be seen when looking at a portion of the night sky.

The dots are drawn inside the boundaries of an "enclosure"; this can be a
rectangle, a circle, or a polygon |dash| but this shape is not, itself, drawn.

The number of dots drawn depends on the "density", which is the product of the
actual area of the shape multiplied by the density value.



.. HINT::

    If you want repeatable randomness - that is to say, the same sequence of
    random numbers being generated every time the program is run - then assign
    a value to the *seeding* property; for example:

    .. code:: python

      Starfield(seeding=42)

    The images used for this document are created with such a setting; but only
    to avoid the code repository detecting a "change" each time the script runs.

Example 1. Default Starfield
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. |sf0| image:: images/defaults/starfield.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|sf0| This example shows the shape constructed using the command with only
      defaults:

      .. code:: python

          Starfield()

      It has the following properties based on the defaults:

      - upper-left corner at x-position ``0`` cm and y-position ``0`` cm
      - an enclosing rectangle with *height* and *width* of ``1`` cm
      - 10 randomly placed ``white`` *color* 'dots' (the starfield *density*)

      Because the default fill color is ``white``, this example adds an extra
      `Rectangle()` shape, with a fill of ``black``, which is drawn first and
      is hence "behind" the field of dots.

            colors=[white, white, red, green, blue],
            sizes=[0.4]
        )

      It has the following properties set:

      - upper-left corner at x-position ``0`` cm and y-position ``0`` cm
      - *enclosure* - the rectangle size determines the boundaries of the area
        (*height* and *width* each of ``3`` cm) inside of which the stars (dots) are
        randomly drawn
      - *density* - there will be a total of "80 multiplied by the enclosure
        area" dots drawn
      - *colors* - is a list of colors, one of which will be randomly chosen
        each time before drawing a dot
      - *sizes* - is a list of randomly chosen dot sizes; in this case there is
        just one value and so all dots will be same size

      Because the default fill color is white, this example adds an extra
      `Rectangle()` shape, with a fill color of black, which is drawn first and
      is hence "behind" the field of dots.

        )

      It has the following properties set:

      - upper-left "corner" at x-position ``0`` cm and at y-position ``0`` cm
      - *enclosure* - the `circle` radius (``1.5`` cm) determines the boundaries
        of the area inside of which the stars (dots) are randomly drawn
      - *density* - there will be a total of "30 multiplied by the enclosure
        area" dots drawn
      - *sizes* - is a list of available dot sizes, one of which is randomly
        chosen from the list each time before drawing a dot

      Because the default fill color is white, this example adds an extra
      `Circle()` shape, with a fill color of black, which is drawn first and is
      hence "behind" the field of dots.

        )

      It has the following properties set:

      - upper-left "corner" at x-position ``1.5`` cm and y-position ``1.4`` cm
      - *enclosure* - the polygon radius (``1.5`` cm) determines the boundaries
        of the area inside of which the stars (dots) are randomly drawn
      - *density* - there will be a total of "50 multiplied by the enclosure
        area" dots drawn
      - *colors* - a list of available dot colors, one of which is randomly
        chosen from the list each time before drawing a dot
      - *sizes* - a list of available dot sizes, one of which is randomly
        chosen from the list each time before drawing a dot

.. _compoundIndex:

Compound Shapes
---------------
`↑ <table-of-contents-core_>`_

Compound shapes are ones composed of multiple elements; but the program takes
care of drawing all of them based on the properties supplied.

The following are all such shapes:

- `Blueprint`_
- `DotGrid`_
- `Grid`_
- `Hexagons`_
- `Image`_
- `Lines`_
- `Rectangles`_
- `Table`_


.. _blueprint-command:

Blueprint
~~~~~~~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

This shape is primarily intended to support drawing while it is "in progress".
It provides a quick and convenient underlying grid that can help to orientate
and place other shapes that *are* required for the final product.  Typically,
one would just comment out this command when its purpose has been served.

On the grid, the values of **x** appear across the lower edge (increasing
from left to right); those for **y** along the left side (increasing from
top to bottom). The grid respects the margins that have been set but you will
observe that the Blueprint numbering itself is located inside the margin area!

Different styling options are provided that can make the Blueprint more
useful in different contexts.

.. NOTE::

   There is more detail about the various properties that can be defined for a
   Blueprint in the :ref:`customised Blueprint <blueprintIndex>` section.

      - has vertical and horizontal lines filling the page from the lower left
        corner up to the right-most and top-most margins
      - has interval between the lines of ``1`` cm
      - default line color is a shade of ``blue`` (hexadecimal ``#2F85AC``)

            subdivisions=5,
            stroke_width=0.5,
            style='invert')

      It has the following properties set:

      - *subdivisions* - set to ``5``
      - *stroke_width* - set to ``0.5``; slightly thicker line makes
        the main grid more visible
      - *style* - set to ``invert`` so that the lines and number colors are white
        and the fill color is now a shade of ``blue`` (``#2F85AC``)

      The *subdivisions* are the thinner lines that are drawn between each pair
      of primary lines |dash| they do not have any numbering and are *dotted*.
===== ======


.. _dotgrid-command:

DotGrid
~~~~~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

A DotGrid is a series of dots |dash| both in the vertical and horizontal
directions. This will, by default, fill the page, as far as possible,
between its margins.

      It has the following properties based on the defaults:

      - the upper-left of the grid is drawn at the absolute page x-position
        of ``0`` cm and y-position ``0`` cm i.e. the margins are ignored
      - a set of dots, spaced ``1`` cm apart, are created extending to the

            dot_width=1,
            offset_y=-0.25)

      To simulate the dot grid found in Moleskine notebooks, it
      has the following properties set:

      - *width* and *height* - intervals between the centre of the dots
        in the x- and y-directions respectively
      - *dot_width* - set to be smaller than the default of ``3``
      - *stroke*  - set to ``darkgrey`` i.e. lighter than the default black
      - *offset_y* - moves the start of the grid slightly downwards by 1/4 cm

      .. HINT::

         For a notebook page for *actual* use, you could consider setting
         the page color.

         To change the page color, set the *fill* property of the ``Create()``
         command.

         A color like ``"cornsilk"`` might provide a suitable backdrop
         for the light grey of the grid.

.. _grid-command:

Grid

      It has the following properties based on the defaults:

      - *side* - set to ``0.85`` cm (about 1/3 of an inch)
        which sets the size of both the x- and y-direction
      - *stroke_width* - set to ``1`` point; the thicker line makes the grid
        more visible
      - *stroke* - set to ``gray`` i.e. a lighter color than the default black

              stroke="gray", stroke_width=1,
              heading="Heading", label="Label", title="Title"
          )

      It has the following properties set for it:

      - *x* and *y* - each set to ``0.5`` cm; offsets the grid's upper-left
        corner from the page margin
      - *height* - value of ``1.25`` cm set for the row height
      - *width* - value of ``1`` cm set for the column width
      - *cols* and *rows* - ``3`` columns wide by ``4`` rows high
      - *stroke_width* - set to ``1`` point; the thicker line makes
        the grid clearly visible
      - *stroke* - set to ``gray`` i.e. a lighter color than the default black
      - *heading*, *label* and *title* - see `Text Descriptions`_

      The grid now has a fixed "rows by columns" size, rather than being
      automatically calculated to fill up the page.

.. _image-command:

Image
~~~~~
`↑ <shape-index_>`_

Pedantically speaking, an image is not like the other shapes in the sense that
it does not consist of lines and areas drawn by **protograf** itself.

An "image" refers to an external file which is simply inserted into the page.

The Image shape shares a number of common aspects with other shapes - such as
an x & y position, a width and a height, the ability to be rotated, and the
setting of labl, heading or title text.

An image can have its corners rounded by setting a value for ``rounding``.
Be aware this is a pixel-based value and does not correspond to the units
used elsewhere in **protograf**.

An image can also be "drawn over" by other shapes appearing later on in the
script.

If an image has a transparent area, this will be respected and shapes
appearing earlier on in the script may then be visible "below" it (see
example below).

      .. code:: python

          Image()

      Will show this message::

          FEEDBACK:: Unable to load image - no name provided

      This example then shows the shape constructed with just a single property:

      .. code:: python

        Image("sholes_typewriter.png")

      This first, unnamed property is the filename of the image.

      If no directory is supplied for the image, it is assumed to be
      in the same as that of the script.

      The image has the following other properties based on the defaults:

      - upper-left corner - x-position ``1`` cm and y-position ``1`` cm

          title="45\u00B0",
          rotation=45)

      Each image has the following properties set for it:

      - name of the image file; this must be the first property set
      - *x* and *y* - these values set the upper-left corner
      - *height* - set to ``1.5`` cm; this value may cause some distortion
      - *width* - set to ``1.5`` cm; this value may cause some distortion

      Two of the images |dash| the ones on the right |dash| are rotated about
      a centre point:

      - *rotation* - degrees, anti-clockwise, about the centre

      The image centre is calculated based on it's height and width.

      In this example, a grey-filled rectangle, with dotted border, is
      drawn just prior to the image.

      The same image is used in two places here to demonstrate the following:

      - how a "background" or "lower level" shape is visible through the
        transparency of a PNG image;
      - where the label, heading and title for an image will appear;

.. _shapes-common-properties:

Shapes Common Properties
------------------------
`↑ <table-of-contents-core_>`_

The following are properties common to many shapes that can be set to create
the desired output:

- `x and y`_
- `cx and cy`_
- `Centre Shape`_
- `Centre Shapes`_
- `Dot and Cross`_
- `Fill and Stroke`_
- `Rotation`_
- `Radii Shapes`_
- `Text Descriptions`_
- `Transparency`_
- `Vertex Shapes`_
- `Wave Styles`_

.. _coreShapeXY:

x and y
~~~~~~~
`^ <shapes-common-properties_>`_

Almost every shape will need to have its :ref:`position <position-concept>` set.
"Position" here usually refers to a point corresponding to the top-left of that
shape.

The common way to do this is by setting a value for **x** |dash| the distance
from the left margin of the page (or card) to the left edge of the shape;
and/or **y** |dash| the distance from the top margin of the page (or card)
to the top edge of the shape.

.. NOTE::

    Its more appropriate to think of this position as that of the "bounding
    box" of the shape i.e. imagine a rectangle drawn such that the shape
    just fits inside it; the "position" is the point corresponding to the
    top-left of that imaginary Rectangle.

.. _coreShapeCxCy:

cx and cy
~~~~~~~~~
`^ <shapes-common-properties_>`_

Almost every shape will need to have its :ref:`position <position-concept>` set.
"Position" here refers to a point corresponding to the centre of that shape.

For shapes that support it, the way to do this is by setting a value for **cx**
|dash| the distance from the left margin of the page (or card) to the centre
position of the shape and/or **cy** |dash| the distance from the bottom margin
of the page (or card) to the centre position of the shape.

.. _coreShapeFillStroke:

Fill and Stroke
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`^ <shapes-common-properties_>`_

Almost every single shape will have a *stroke*, corresponding to the color of
the line used to draw it, and a *stroke_width* which is the thickness in
points (72 points per inch); the default line color is *black*.

All `Enclosed Shapes`_ will have a *fill* corresponding to the color used for
the area inside it; the default fill color is *white*.

A "shortcut" to setting both fill and stroke to be the same for a shape,
is to use the property *fill_stroke* (see Example 2 below).

If the fill is set to the :ref:`keyword <reserved-names-concept>` ``None``
(note the uppercase "N"), the area will have no fill color, and effectively
becomes transparent.

If the stroke is set to the :ref:`keyword <reserved-names-concept>` ``None``
(note the uppercase "N"), the line will have no color, and effectively
becomes transparent.


Example 1. Fill & Stroke
++++++++++++++++++++++++
`↑ <coreShapeFillStroke_>`_

.. |fsb| image:: images/defaults/fill-stroke.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|fsb| This example shows a shape constructed using the command:

      .. code:: python

          Rectangle(
              fill="yellow", stroke="red",
              stroke_width=6)

      The shape has the following properties that differ from the defaults:

      - *fill* color of ``yellow`` for the interior of the shape
      - *stroke* color of ``red`` for the border of the shape
      - *stroke_width* - set to ``6`` points (about 2mm or 0.2cm)

      It can be seen that very thick lines "straddle" a centre line running
      through the defined location.

      In this case the Rectangle is both larger in outer dimensions than the
      expected 1x1 cm and smaller in inner dimensions than the expected 1x1 cm
      due to the thickness of the lines used to construct it.

===== ======

Example 2. Fill_Stroke
++++++++++++++++++++++
`↑ <coreShapeFillStroke_>`_

The *fill_stroke* property is a "shortcut" which sets **both** the
*fill* and *stroke* color at same time.

.. |fst| image:: images/defaults/fill-and-stroke.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|fst| This example shows a shape constructed using the command:

      .. code:: python

          Circle(fill_stroke="cyan")

      The shape has the following property that differ from the defaults:

      - *fill_stroke* color of ``cyan``

      Here, the line color used to draw the circumference is the same as
      the fill color of the interior.

===== ======

.. _coreShapeDotCross:

Dot and Cross
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`^ <shapes-common-properties_>`_

For shapes that have a definable centre e.g. a `Circle`_, a `Square`_
or a `Hexagon`_, it is possible to place a dot, a cross, or both at this
location.

The color for the dot and cross will, if not provided, take on the stroke
color of the shape of which they are part |dash| see the `Stadium` example
below.

.. |dnc| image:: images/customised/dots_crosses.png

        Polygon(
            cx=1, cy=3, sides=8,
            radius=1,
            dot=0.1,
            dot_stroke="orange")
        Polygon(
            cx=3, cy=3, sides=8, diameter=2,
            cross=0.25,
            cross_stroke="orange",
            cross_stroke_width=1)

        Rhombus(
            cx=1, cy=5, side=2,
            dot=0.1,
            dot_stroke="red")
        Rhombus(
            cx=3, cy=5, side=2,
            cross=0.25,
            cross_stroke="red",
            cross_stroke_width=1)

      The shapes have their properties set as follows:

      - *cx* and *cy* set the centre point of the shape
      - *dot* - sets the size of dot at the centre
      - *dot_stroke*  - sets the color (and fill) of the dot; defaults to match the
        *stroke* of the shape that it is part of
      - *cross* - sets the length of each of the two lines that cross at the
        centre
      - *cross_stroke*  - sets the color of the cross lines; defaults to the
        stroke of the shape that it is part of
      - *cross_stroke_width* - sets the thickness of the cross lines
===== ======

.. _coreShapeRotation:

Rotation
~~~~~~~~
`^ <shapes-common-properties_>`_

Every shape, whose *centre* can be calculated, will support a *rotation*
property. Rotation takes place in anti-clockwise direction, from the horizontal,
around the centre of the shape, in *degrees*.

Example 1. Rhombus Rotation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
`↑ <coreShapeRotation_>`_

.. |rt1| image:: images/customised/rhombus_red_rotation.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|rt1| This example shows the shape constructed using these commands:

      .. code:: python

        Rhombus(
            cx=2, cy=3,
            width=1.5,
            height=2*equilateral_height(1.5),
            fill=None, stroke="black",
            dot=0.06)
        Rhombus(
            cx=2, cy=3,
            width=1.5,
            height=2*equilateral_height(1.5),
            fill=None, stroke="red",
            dot=0.03,
            rotation=60)

      The shape with the *black* outline and large dot in the centre is the
      "normal" Rhombus.

      The shape with the *red* outline and smaller, red dot in the centre is
      the rotated Rhombus. It has these properties:

      - *fill* color - `None` so no fill is used; this makes it completely
        transparent.
      - *rotation* - ``60`` is the number of degrees, anti-clockwise, that
        it has been rotated

      The shapes are completely transparent, so its possible to see
      how the second is drawn relative to the first.

      The examples have the following properties:

      - *centre* - using `cx` and `cy` values
      - *radius* - ``1`` cm in each case
      - *sides* - the default of 6 in each case ("hexagon" shape)
      - *rotation* - varies from 0 |deg| to 60 |deg| (anti-clockwise from the
        horizontal)

. _coreRadiiShapes:

Radii Shapes
~~~~~~~~~~~~
`^ <shapes-common-properties_>`_

A number of shapes, that are formed by drawing lines between a set of
vertices ("corner points"), can be styled by placing other shapes which
can be located those lines.

Radii shapes are constructed using the following properties:

- *radii_shapes* - this a list (values in ``[...]``) of value sets that
  determine the "where and what" should be drawn along the line of
  specific radius.  Each set, enclosed in brackets``(...)`` can consist
  of three comma-separated parts:

  - the first is the **direction**, or directions, of the relevant radii;
    this can be a string e.g. ``"n e"`` or a list e.g. ``["n", "e"]``.
    Note that for a ``Circle`` the direction is the number of degrees
    (anti-clockwise from 0 |deg| in the east direction) whereas for
    other shapes it will be a :ref:`compass direction <termsDirection>`.
  - the second is the **shape** to be drawn
  - the optional third part is the **fractional distance** along the line
    at which the shape should be drawm; dy default this is ``1`` i.e. the
    length of the radial line |dash| if it is less than ``1`` the radii
    shape will be drawn inside of the parent shape; and if it is more than
    ``1`` the radii shape will be drawn outside of, or away from, the parent
    shape
- *radii_shapes_rotated* - an optional property which, if ``True``, will
  rotate the vertex shapes such they "point" away from the centre of the
  parent shape

Radii shapes can be constructed for:

- :ref:`EquilateralTriangle <equilateraltriangle-command>`
- :ref:`Hexagon <hexagon-command>`
- :ref:`Rectangle <rectangle-command>`
- :ref:`Rhombus <rhombus-command>`
- :ref:`Circle <circle-command>`

      All of these examples use a common settings in ``ccom`` to draw
      the vertex shape |dash| a circle; but the *label* property set as
      a visual indicator

      Note that in some cases, setting the *fractional_distance* (the
      third value in the set) causes the radii shape to be moved
      closer to, or further away from, the centre.

      The use of ``radii_shapes_rotated=True`` will means all of these
      examples have the radii shapes rotated to face "away" from the
      parent shape's centre.

      .. HINT::

          Although not shown above, multiple entries can be made for a given
          direction; for example, to draw a circle and a dot along the ``ne``

.. _coreShapeText:

Text Descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`^ <shapes-common-properties_>`_

Being able to associate a description, or identifier, with a shape can be
useful.

There are three kinds of text that can be added to a shape, without having to
specify their location or other details.

.. NOTE::

   Obviously, a `Text`_ shape can also be placed anywhere, including being
   superimposed on another shape, in order to handle more complex text needs.

The three "simple" text types that can be added to a shape are:

- *heading* - this appears above the shape (slightly offset)
- *label* - this appears in the middle of the shape
- *title* - this appears below the shape (slightly offset)

All types are, by default, centred horizontally. Each type can be customised
in terms of its color, size and font family by appending *_stroke*, *_size*
and *_font* respectively to the text type's name; so ``heading_font="Courier``
will set the font family for the heading appearing above the shape.

The *label* text can, in addition, be **moved** relative to the shape's centre
by using the *mx* and *my* properties; positive values will move the text to
the right and down; and negative values will move the text to the left and up.

Example 1. Heading, Label and Title

      default properties:

      .. code:: python

        Hexagon(
            cx=2, cy=1.5, height=1.5,
            title="Title",
            label="Label",
            heading="Heading")

        Rectangle(
            x=0.5, y=3, width=3, height=2,
            label="red; size=14",
            label_stroke="red", label_size=14)

      The Hexagon shows where the *heading*, *label* and *title* appear
      relative to the shape's boundaries, with default font size of 12 points.

      The Rectangle shows how the *label* can be customised in terms of its
      *stroke* (``red``) and font *size* (``14`` points).

|tx2| This example shows six Rectangles constructed using the command with
      additional properties:

      .. code:: python

        rct = Common(
          height=1.0, width=1.75,
          stroke_width=0.5, label_size=7)

        Rectangle(
          common=rct, x=0, y=0.0, label="offset -x, -y",
          label_mx=-0.2, label_my=-0.2)
        Rectangle(
          common=rct, x=0, y=1.5, label="offset -x",
          label_mx=-0.3)
        Rectangle(
          common=rct, x=0, y=3.0, label="offset -x, +y",
          label_mx=-0.2, label_my=0.2)
        Rectangle(
          common=rct, x=2, y=0.0, label="offset +x, -y",
          label_mx=0.2, label_my=-0.2)
        Rectangle(
          common=rct, x=2, y=1.5, label="offset +x",
          label_mx=0.3)
        Rectangle(
          common=rct, x=2, y=3.0, label="offset +x, +y",
          label_mx=0.2, label_my=0.2)
        Rectangle(
          common=rct, x=0, y=4.5, label="offset -y",
          label_my=-0.2)
        Rectangle(
          common=rct, x=2, y=4.5, label="offset +y",
          label_my=0.2)

      Setting values for *label_my* and *label_mx* cause the label to
      shift away from centre.

      Positive values move the label down and to the right while
      negative values move it up and to the left.

===== ======

.. _coreTransparency:

Transparency
~~~~~~~~~~~~
`^ <shapes-common-properties_>`_

All `Enclosed Shapes`_, that have a *fill*, can have a transparency value set
that will affect the fill color used for the area inside them.

If a shape needs to be completely transparent - i.e. no color at all being
visible - then set the *fill* value to ``None``.

.. |trn| image:: images/defaults/transparency.png
   :width: 330

===== ======
|trn| This example shows a number of Rectangles constructed as follows:

      .. code:: python

            fill="#008000", stroke="#C0C0C0",
            transparency=25, label="25%")
        Rectangle(

            fill="#008000", stroke="#C0C0C0",
            transparency=75, label="75%")

        Rectangle(
            x=0, y=0, height=2, width=2,
            fill="yellow", stroke="yellow")
        Rectangle(

            fill="red", stroke="red",
            transparency=50)

      The three green Rectangles shapes have the following property set:

      - *transparency* - the higher the value, the more "see through" the color

      The red Rectangle, which also has a *transparency* value, is drawn
      partially over the yellow Rectangle on the upper-left.

      When overdrawn, there is a color change in the overlapping section
      i.e. "bleed through" occurs.

.. _coreCentreShape:

Centre Shape
~~~~~~~~~~~~
`^ <shapes-common-properties_>`_

Any shape that can be defined using its centre, may have another shape |dash|
called a "centre shape" |dash| placed inside of it.

.. NOTE::

   In terms of drawing order, the  "centre shape" is drawn after most of the
   shape's other properties: only a dot, cross or label (if any of these are
   defined) will be drawn superimposed on the centre-shape.

        Polygon(
            cx=1, cy=5, radius=0.5, sides=8,
            centre_shape=small_star)
        EquilateralTriangle(
            x=2.35, y=5.5, side=1.25,
            centre_shape=small_star)
        Rectangle(
            x=0.5, y=2.5, height=1, width=1.25,

        Square(
            x=2.5, y=0.5, height=1,
            centre_shape=small_star)

      At the start, a Star shape is defined by the lowercase ``star()``

      A lowercase command means the shape is not drawn at this time but is
      assigned to a named value and can be referred to further on.

      Each of the other shapes in the script can now use this named shape
      as their ``centre_shape``.

      Regardless of whether the primary shape's position is
      defined using ``x`` and ``y``, or  ``cx`` and ``cy``, the Star
      is still drawn in the centre of that shape.

Example 2. Off-Centre
+++++++++++++++++++++
`↑ <coreCentreShape_>`_

.. |cs1| image:: images/customised/shape_centred_move.png
   :width: 330

The centre-shape can be shifted from the centre by setting values for
*centre_shape_mx* and *centre_shape_my*.

===== ======
|cs1| This example shows two Hexagon shapes constructed as follows:

      .. code:: python

        small_star = star(radius=0.25)
        small_circle = circle(
            radius=0.33, fill="gray",
            centre_shape=small_star)

        Hexagon(
            x=1, y=0.5, height=2,
            hatches_count=5,
            dot=0.1,
            centre_shape=small_circle)

        Hexagon(
            x=1, y=3, height=2,
            centre_shape=small_circle,
            centre_shape_mx=0.3, centre_shape_my=0.6)

      As in the first example, the ``small_star`` is defined but not drawn.

      The ``small_star`` is assigned as the ``centre_shape``  to
      ``small_circle``; a shape that is also not drawn.

      This ``small_circle`` is now used as the ``centre_shape``
      for both of the Hexagons.

      The upper Hexagon shows how the centre-shape is drawn
      over other features, such as the hatches, in the Hexagon,
      **except** for the ``dot``.

      The lower Hexagon shows how the centre-shape can be moved with the
      ``*_mx`` and ``*_my`` values.

      Positive values move the shape down and to the right while
      negative values move it up and to the left.

      These various shapes and their custom properties are described
      elsewhere in the documentation; this example just serves to show
      how they can be used together.

.. _coreCentreShapes:

Centre Shapes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`^ <shapes-common-properties_>`_

Any shape that can be defined using its centre, may have multiple shapes |dash|
called "centre shapes" |dash| placed inside of it.

These shapes are supplied as a list of sets; for example ``[(shape1), (shape2)]``

.. NOTE::

   In terms of drawing order, the  "centre shapes" are drawn after most of the
   shape's other properties: only a dot, cross or label (if any of these are
   defined) will be drawn superimposed on the centre shapes.

Example 1. Centres
++++++++++++++++++

.. |ss1| image:: images/customised/shapes_centred.png
   :width: 330

Any centre-shape can be shifted from the centre by setting values for
the change in ``x`` and ``y`` values as part of the set.

===== ======
|ss1| This example shows centre shapes constructed as follows:

      .. code:: python

        small_dot = dot(dot_width=4, fill="red")
        big_dot = dot(dot_width=8)

        Hexagon(
            x=0.5, y=0.5, height=1,
            centre_shapes=[
                (small_dot), (big_dot, 0.2, 0.2)])
        Rhombus(
            x=2.4, y=0.3,
            height=1.5, width=1.25,
            centre_shapes=[
                (small_dot), (big_dot, 0.2, 0.2)])
        Rectangle(
            x=0.5, y=2.5,
            height=1, width=1.25,
            centre_shapes=[
                (small_dot), (big_dot, 0.2, 0.2)])
        Circle(
            cx=3, cy=3,
            radius=0.5,
            centre_shapes=[
                (small_dot), (big_dot, 0.2, 0.2)])
        Polygon(
            cx=1, cy=5,
            radius=0.5, sides=8,
            centre_shapes=[
                (small_dot), (big_dot, 0.2, 0.2)])
        EquilateralTriangle(
            x=2.35, y=5.5, side=1.25,
            centre_shapes=[
                (small_dot), (big_dot, 0.2, 0.2)])

      At the start, two Dot shapes are defined by the lowercase ``dot()``

      A lowercase command means the shapes are not drawn at this time but
      assigned to named values and can be referred to further on.

      Each of the other shapes in the script can now use these named shapes
      as their ``centre_shapes``.

      The ``small_dot`` (which is red )is used "as is" and so by default is
      drawn at the centre of its parent shape; the ``big_dot`` is given offset
      values for the x and y positions - so is drawn below and to the right
      of centre.

. _coreVertexShapes:

Vertex Shapes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`^ <shapes-common-properties_>`_

A number of shapes, that are formed by drawing lines between a set of
vertices ("corner points"), can be styled by placing other shapes which
will be centered on those points.

Vertex shapes are constructed using the following properties:

- *vertex_shapes* - this a list (values in ``[...]``) of shapes that
  should be placed on vertices, in the order that these vertices are
  drawn
- *vertex_shapes_rotated* - an optional setting which, if ``True``, will
  rotate the vertex shapes such they "point" away from the centre of the
  parent shape

Vertex shapes can be constructed for:

- :ref:`EquilateralTriangle <equilateraltriangle-command>`
- :ref:`Hexagon <hexagon-command>`
- :ref:`Polygon <polygon-command>`
- :ref:`Rectangle <rectangle-command>`
- :ref:`Rhombus <rhombus-command>`
- :ref:`Star <star-command>`

            cx=1, cy=1,
            height=1,
            width=1.5,
            vertex_shapes=[
                circle(radius=0.15, label="R")] * 4,
            vertex_shapes_rotated=True)
        Hexagon(
            cx=3, cy=1,
            radius=1,
            vertex_shapes=[

            vertex_shapes_rotated=True)
        Trapezoid(
            cx=3, cy=3,
            width=1.5, top=1, height=1.25,
            vertex_shapes=[
                circle(radius=0.15, label="T")] * 5,
            vertex_shapes_rotated=True)
        EquilateralTriangle(
            cx=1, cy=5,
            side=1.5,
            vertex_shapes=[
                circle(radius=0.15, label="E")] * 3,
            vertex_shapes_rotated=True)
        Star(
            cx=3, cy=5,
            radius=1,
            rays=5,
            vertex_shapes=[
                circle(radius=0.15, label="S")] * 5,
            vertex_shapes_rotated=True)

      All of these examples use the shortcut approach to create the correct
      number of vertex shapes i.e. ``[SomeShape] * N`` where ``N`` is the
      number of repeats of that shape.  In other cases, it could be that
      this is a list of distinctly different shapes.  Any vertices which
      should be omitted can just use the ``None`` value to indicate that.

      The use of ``vertex_shapes_rotated=True`` will means all of these
      examples have the vertex shapes rotated to face "away" from the
      parent shape's centre.

.. _coreWave:

Wave Styles
~~~~~~~~~~~
`^ <shapes-common-properties_>`_

A number of shapes, that make use of straight line properties, can be styled
using their "wave" property.

These include the *radii* and *perbii* properties of Circle, Hexagon, Polygon
and Rectangle (for details on those properties, see the section on
:doc:`Customised Shapes <customised_shapes>`).  In addition, the lines used
to construct a Polyshape and Polyline can also be styled like waves.
