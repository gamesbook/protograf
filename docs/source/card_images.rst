This section assumes you are very familiar with the concepts, terms and
ideas for :doc:`protograf <index>` as presented in the
:doc:`Basic Concepts <basic_concepts>` , that you understand all of the
:doc:`Additional Concepts <additional_concepts>`
and that you've created some basic scripts of your own using the
:doc:`Core Shapes <core_shapes>`.

    This section provides further information about how images, together with
    fonts, can be used to add graphics to cards. It will be helpful if you have
    already read the other sections referred to in the card's overview section:

The use of icons - small symbols - or images to readily convey information has
become prevelant in board and card games.  Once you understand the meaning or
association of that image in that context, its usually much faster to recognise
and act on it than it is to read a sentence or phrase.

This usage has extended to "embedding" or "inlining" the icon or image in text
itself; so, for example, instead of the phrase *take 2 gold*, the text will say
*+2* |gld|.
