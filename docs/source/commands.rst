  :doc:`protograf <index>` is a small, specialised tool; but its part of a much
  greater Python language "ecosystem", and commands and tools from the
  :doc:`Python language <python_commands>` |dash| or other
  `Python packages <https://pypi.org>`_  |dash| can be used to further enhance
  your own script.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Commands marked with an asterisk (``*``) can be given with a uppercase or
   lowercase initial (``Commmand`` vs ``command``); meaning the shape should
   either be drawn directly at that point in the script, or that it should be
   "stored" to be drawn later.
