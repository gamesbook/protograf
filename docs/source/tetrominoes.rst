Overview
========

Tetrominoes became well-known through the computer game "Tetris", which
originated in 1985.  Tetrominoes are one type of :doc:`Polyominoes <polyominoes>`
and each one is composed of **4** squares in one of 5 unique patterns.

They can referred to by their shortcut ``letter`` property which has been
assigned to each of the 5 shapes, based on their similarity to letters in
the Roman alphabet.
