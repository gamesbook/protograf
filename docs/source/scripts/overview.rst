part of the "core" functionality.


Using Scripts
=============

Scripts are pre-defined sets of code, designed to carry out a specific
functions, or set of functions.

To use a script, you open a terminal and "run" it with Python in a similar way
that you do for a PG script |dash| see
:ref:`Run a file with Python <runWithPython>`.

For example, to run the counters extraction script::

    python -m protograf.scripts.counter_extraction

Some scripts may require additional information to work properly.
