# pyprototypr: Table of Contents

The **pyprototypr** documentation consists of the sections described below.

sections are designed to be read in order - apart from the examples, they all contain
useful information and build on each other.

1. *[Overview](overview.md)* -

**pyprototypr** also has a formal [reference manual](manual_technical.rst)
that documents in more detail all the various elements and commands available in the
program.  This is useful to lookup what the names of options are and how they operate;
but its **NOT** a good way to learn **pyprototypr**.
