# pyprototypr: Table of Contents

The **pyprototypr** documentation consists of the sections described below.

Although its great to be able to just "jump in" and start using a program, these
sections are designed to be read in order- apart from the examples, they all contain
useful information and build on each other.

1. *[Overview](overview.md)* -
    a brief introduction of the purpose and rationale of the program
2. *[Setting Up](setting_up.md)* -
    how to get **pyprototypr** working on your computer
3. *[Basic Concepts](basic_concepts.md)* -
    core aspects of **pyprototypr** that you must know
4. *[Additional Concepts](additional_concepts.md)* -
    additional aspects of **pyprototypr** to help create scripts
5. *[A Worked Example](worked_example.md)* -
    a step-by-step example of creating a script
6. *[Script Anatomy](script_anatomy.md)* -
    how a script is constructed
7. *[Core Shapes](core_shapes.md)* -
    a tour of the core elements available to you
8. *[Advanced Commands](advanced_commands.md)* -
    how to work with common or repetitive elements
9. *[Card Decks](card_decks.md)* -
    how to create a deck, or set, of cards
10. *[Hexagonal Grids](hexagonal_grids.md)* -

11. *[Available Examples](available_examples.md)* -
    an overview of the examples provided with **pyprototypr**
12. *[Additional Resources](additional_resources.md)* -
    links to information for supplementing prototypes

**pyprototypr** also has a formal [reference manual](manual_technical.rst)
that documents in more detail all the various elements and commands available in the
program.  This is useful to lookup what the names of options are and how they operate;
but its *NOT* a good way to learn **pyprototypr**.
