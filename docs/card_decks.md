# pyprototypr: Decks of Cards

## Introduction

Cards are a common and widely used method of storing and transmitting small
sets of related data.

Scientists have used index cards since the 17th century and, of course, libraries
have used card catalogues as a way to track information about books.
Businesses in the 20th century used Rolodexes and business cards as ways to
track and exchange information about individuals. Early computers used a form
of index cards called "punch" cards to store their data. Playing cards, of
course, have been popular both in China and Europe coming into use somewhere
in the 9th and 14th centuries respectively.

The vast rise in popularity of a game like *Magic the Gathering*, in the 1990s,
has inspired the greater use of cards in all aspects of the modern board gaming
experience, with cards taking a predominant role in many of them.
