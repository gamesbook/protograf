# pyprototypr: Overview

## Introduction

The aim of **pyprototypr** is to provide a general purpose program that allows 
you to design simple and reproducible graphics that can be used in prototyping of
elements or components of a project such as the creation of a board game; the 
board, the tiles, the cards and so on.


## How do I use it?

In general, what you do is type a set of instructions into a file on your computer, 
save that file, and then use Python to create your output - a PDF file - containing 
the results of the instructions; hopefully the design you intended!

> **pyprototypr** is *NOT* a full-blown graphics editor - like the Adobe 
> Photoshop, GIMP, or Inkscape packages - which allow sophisticated editing of
> complex designs - and it does not attempt in any way to replicate their 
> functionality.


## How does it work?

**pyprototypr** is written in Python; the reason being that this is a relatively
easy to use programming language that is often used for scripting or automating
routines - both by itself and as part of larger programs. Python has access to 
numerous libraries that help avoid having to develop code from scratch.

> Python is not a speedy language, but its still fast enough to use for **pyprototypr** 

**pyprototypr** is designed such that you *don't* need to know how to program in 
Python in order to use it; but if you are a Python programmer then you can 
certainly treat this as you would in the other library and add in your additional 
Python code or logic to your scripts for your own purposes.


## Who might want to use **pyprototypr** ?

**pyprototypr** is useful for anyone that needs to work on a design in an
incremental fashion, tweaking and changing as they go along. Doing this with
a regular graphics package can be tedious; especially when common changes need to
be made across many elements.  

Simple designs that make use of regular-shaped symbols or fonts are 
straightforward to implement in **pyprototypr**; but more complex pictures or 
background images should be made, as usual, in a regular graphics design package 
and then accessed.


## How do I get started?

Its suggested that you first get everything [set-up](setting_up.md) and tested. 
Then read through the [basic concepts](basic_concepts.md) before trying out a
[worked example](worked_example.py).
