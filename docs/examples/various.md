### Further Ideas

* Wrap a call to this script via a command that gets runs each minute e.g. via
  `cron` on Linux; this will produce an updated set of times which could be
  displayed automatically on screen by a suitable viewer
* Add a link to an API that generates quotes; use this quote for the header
  text so that a new quote appears each time the script is run
