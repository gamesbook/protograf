Walkthrough of Examples
=======================

The examples supplied with **pyprototypr** attempt to highlight or
demonstrate how different functions or features can be used. They are
not necessarily comprehensive, but do give some ideas as to what can be
done - and how.

1. `Demo <demo.rst>`_ - a quick, somewhat random, tour of various
   elements in **pyprototypr**
2. `Simple <simple.rst>`__ - concrete examples of elements in both basic
   and customised form
3. `Cards <cards.rst>`__ - different kinds of decks that can be
   constructed
4. `Counters <counters.rst>`__ - counters are really just “tiny square
   cards”!
5. *Boards*: `abstract <abstract.rst>`__ and
   `commercial <commercial.rst>`__ - how to construct boards for both
   abstract and “modern” (commercial) games
6. `BGG <bgg.rst>`__ - how to retrieve and display data that can be
   accessed from the BoardGameGeek API
7. `Various <various.rst>`__ - examples of “real world” objects built up
   from different elements in **pyprototypr**
