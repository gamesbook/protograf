Further Ideas
-------------

-  Wrap a call to this script via a command that gets runs each minute
   e.g.Â via ``cron`` on Linux; this will produce an updated set of times
   which could be displayed automatically on screen by a suitable viewer
-  Add a link to an API that generates quotes; use this quote for the
   header text so that a new quote appears each time the script is run
