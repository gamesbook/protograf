* Wrap a call to this script via a command that gets runs each minute e.g. via
  cron on Linux; this will produce an updated set of times which could be
  displayed automatically by a suitable viewer
* Add a link to an API that generates quotes; use this quote for the heaader
  text so that a new quote appears each time the script is run
